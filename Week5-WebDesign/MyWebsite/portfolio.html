        <p> I decided to do Girls Who Code because I want to ammend the lack of female representation in the tech industry. In such a lucrative and important field, diversity is really important, and I think teaching girls to code through programs such as this is a great step to include everyone in a field that is changing the world. </p>

            <h4> Scratch </h4>
            <p> The first project we did used a program called Scratch. This is a block form of programming, used to learn the  basics without having to worry about syntax. We made simple games such as Pig (a dice rolling game), paddle ball, and a jukebox. </p>
            <p> I found Scratch really fun and easy to use. It was a helpful bridge to learning the fundamentals of coding. </p>

            <h4> Python </h4>
            <p> To begin with Python we made a simple text adventure game. We learned about if statements and for/while loops to make our game. In the game, a player was given a series of choices, and if statements were used to determine the player's fate.  </p>
            <p> Although the basic ideas where the same as in Scratch, the new syntax made learning Python a little harder. </p>

            <h4> Pygame </h4>
            <p> Once we understood the syntax of Python, we used Python and a program called Pygame to make a city-scroller (like in some video games, a player stays still while the background moves behind them). We used classes and object orientation to make buildings, draw them, and then scroll them across the screen. 

                <p>To continue the project, we were supposed to add a player, and make it an actual running game. Unfortunately I haven't finished that yet, but I am still owrking on it.  </p>

        <h4> Arduino Robot </h4>
        <p> In this project, we used Arduino/C++ to make a robot sing a song and dance. To make the robot sing we used piezo to sound the tone and programmed each individual note. We then put those notes in a list and called the list to play the whole song. </p>

        <p> To make the robot dance we used Servo and programmed the wheels to move. We then made functions to move forward, backward, left and right. We called those functions to the beat of a song to make it dance. </p>
