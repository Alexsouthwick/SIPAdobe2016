            <h4> Scratch </h4>
            <p> The first project we did used a program called Scratch. This is a block form of programming, used to learn the  basics without having to worry about syntax. We made simple games such as Pig (a dice rolling game), paddle ball, and a jukebox. </p>

            <h4> Python </h4>
            <p> To begin with Python we made a simple text adventure game. We learned about if statements and for/while loops to make our game. In the game, a player was given a series of choices, and if statements were used to determine the player's fate.  </p>

            <h4> Pygame </h4>
            <p> Once we understood the syntax of Python, we used Python and a program called Pygame to make a city-scroller (like in some video games, a player stays still while the background moves behind them). We used classes and object orientation to make buildings, draw them, and then scroll them across the screen. </p>

        <h4> Arduino Robot </h4>
        <p> In this project, we used Arduino to make a robot sing a song and dance. To make the robot sing we used piezo to sound the tone and programmed each individual note. We then put those notes in a list and called the list to play the whole song. </p>

        <p> To make the robot dance we used Servo and programmed the wheels to move. We then made functions to move forward, backward, left and right. We called those functions to the beat of a song to make it dance. </p>

    <div class= "bio"
        <p> I am a Junior at Lick-Wilmerding High School in San Francisco. I decided to do Girls Who Code because I want to ammend the lack of female representation in the tech industry. In such a lucrative and important field, diversity is really important, and I think teaching girls to code through programs such as this, is a great step to include everyone in a field that is changing the world. </p>
